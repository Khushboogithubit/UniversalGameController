# Universal Game Controller using Python and OpenCV

This project is a simple yet powerful implementation of a **game controller using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe**. With this controller, you can play games using **hand gestures captured by a webcam**. Itâ€™s a fun way to learn about **computer vision, gesture recognition, and game automation**.  

Letâ€™s get started ðŸš€

---

## Installation

Install the required packages with pip:

```bash
pip install mediapipe
pip install opencv-python
pip install pynput

Deployment
To deploy and run this project, execute:

bash
Copy
Edit
python gesture.py
or for direct keyboard/mouse input:

bash
Copy
Edit
python direct.py
Example Code (Gesture Control)
python
Copy
Edit
import cv2
import mediapipe as mp
from pynput.keyboard import Key, Controller

cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)
keyboard = Controller()

mp_hands = mp.solutions.hands
hands = mp_hands.Hands(min_detection_confidence=0.7, max_num_hands=1)
mp_draw = mp.solutions.drawing_utils

while True:
    success, img = cap.read()
    img_rgb = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
    results = hands.process(img_rgb)

    if results.multi_hand_landmarks:
        for hand_landmarks in results.multi_hand_landmarks:
            mp_draw.draw_landmarks(img, hand_landmarks, mp_hands.HAND_CONNECTIONS)

        # Example logic: all fingers closed â†’ press LEFT, all open â†’ press RIGHT
        # (Custom mapping can be added in gesture.py)
        # keyboard.press(Key.left) or keyboard.press(Key.right)

    cv2.imshow("Universal Game Controller", img)
    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break
Output
Run the project and control your favorite games ðŸŽ® using just your hand gestures in front of a webcam.
